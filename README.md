Notes


This is my first project in C# and SQL, created as part of my studies. As a beginner, I developed it with the guidance of structured lessons to build a foundational understanding of both the programming language and database management. The project is written in Swedish and served as an important step in my learning journey, giving me valuable insights into how C# and SQL work together.
