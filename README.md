Notes

I recently completed my first project in C# and SQL as part of my studies. As a beginner, I worked on this project with the guidance of structured lessons, which helped me build a basic understanding of both the programming language and database management. The project, written in Swedish, was an important step in my learning journey and provided me with valuable insights into how C# and SQL work together. :)
